## Introduction

The 3D models generated with Blender can be published embedded in web-pages using a variety of different tools. This post links to some alternative web-resources for 3D publishing, and then focus on an open source solution.

## Alternative 3D publishing tools

Looking for different alternatives, I finally found a page on [investintech.com](https://www.investintech.com) that presents [4 Cool Ways To View 3D Content In Your Browser](https://www.investintech.com/resources/blog/archives/2702-4-cool-ways-to-view-3d-content-in-your-browser.html). The 4 cool tools are:

- [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com)
- [Online 3D viewer](http://3dviewer.net)
- [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/feed)
- [p3d.in](https://p3d.in)

### [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com)

GrabCAD is a community made up of a wide range of engineers. Browsing [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com) in March 2022 I could not find out how to publish a 3D model, but perhaps if you look more carefully.

### [Online 3D viewer](http://3dviewer.net)

With [Online 3D viewer](http://3dviewer.net) you can view 3D files by uploading the most common formats. By linking (url) to a 3D model that you have uploaded a-priori, you will get a code that you can simple paste into your own web-page. The last part of this post illustrates a 3D-model generated by [Online 3D viewer](http://3dviewer.net).

### [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/feed)

[Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/feed) is a portal for producing, sharing and selling 3D models. To use the 3D viewer for embedding models in your own web-pages requires a subscription with a non-negligible fee.

### [P3D.in](https://p3d.in)

[P3D.in](https://p3d.in) is similar to [Online 3D viewer](http://3dviewer.net), allowing importing, viewing and sharing your 3D models.  Although you can opt in for a paid account with extended features, this tool is completely free to use. But I did not try it out

## Test with [Online 3D viewer](http://3dviewer.net)

From the alternative above I tested [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com) (could not find how to create the actual 3D viewer), [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/feed) (required a fee for allowing embedding of 3D viewer in external pages) and [Online 3D viewer](http://3dviewer.net) (that worked fine).

With [Online 3D viewer](http://3dviewer.net)  I just uploaded an <span class='file'>.stl</span> file of my 3Dmodel, lined the url to [Online 3D viewer](http://3dviewer.net) and then retriewed the following code:

```
<iframe width="640" height="480" style="border:1px solid #eeeeee;" src="https://3dviewer.net/embed.html#model=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karttur/common/master/3dmodels/spectro-box-5pogos-HAMA_20220325_v072p_view.glb$camera=145.98631,-25.56383,58.62943,0.00000,-0.55000,10.65000,-0.28242,-0.86903,0.40625$envsettings=fishermans_bastion,off$backgroundcolor=255,255,255$defaultcolor=135,227,197$edgesettings=off,0,0,0,1"></iframe>
```

The exact same code is pasted below, and the result is the 3D model that you can navigate around.
